# aScrape <br>
Developed using Next.js and Bright Data's webunlocker, this e-commerce product scraping site is designed to alert users for when a product they desire on Amazon experiences a change in price. It notifies users when a product drops in price and helps competitors by alerting them when the product is out of stock, all managed and kept up to date through cron jobs. <br> <br>
All of the Back-End work has been completed for this project as the scraping and mailing functions have been implemented and tested to work <br>
Most of the Front-End work are done, however there are still many ways to make this website more interactive and things to be fixed, until then I will keep working on this project until it is fully done and deployed!
